## The Ten Myths of Innovation: The best summary 
**Author: Scott Berkun**
(March, 2013)

This article summarizes in ten myths the things that Scott Berkun wish to have learned about “big ideas” before he started 
his career.  
  
The list of the ten myths is a sharp, bright and objective approach to contextualize and to think more critically about 
all the information available over the “Innovation” theme. There are a lot of ideas from many different people around the 
globe of how the innovation process occurs or should be done, and a lot of this information can be consider as incomplete 
or incorrect and the author explains why this happen frequently.  
  
The author claims that some of the big mistakes over the writings and information available on Innovation  
is a constantly wrong approach and is frequently misguiding to those who are interested in the theme because   
the information is rarely contextualized and constantly tries to sell itself as a unique way of doing things  
not giving the right importance to the always uncontrollable variables of the present and the truth circumstances  
that lead some ideas to succeed.  
  
Here are the then myths listed below:  
1. The myth of epiphany  
2. The myth of a method.  
3. The myth we love new ideas.  
4. The myth of the lone inventor.  
5. The myth that good ideas are rare.  
6. The myth your boss knows more than you.  
7. The myth that the best idea wins.  
8. The myth that problems are less interesting than solutions.  
9. The myth that innovation is always good.  
10. The  myth that we know history

## 2nd Lecture

## Resonate
## Present visual stories that transform audiencies
**Author: Nancy Duarte**

Resonate is an inspiring and disruptive book explaining how to improve our channels of communication, the author explains how to present information in a more dynamic and creative way in order to keep getting the attention of your receptor when you have to send a message to an audience.
As the book explains, we have to keep looking for ways to present the information we want to send because humans tend to familiarize pretty quick with the always new ways of how information is presented and the problem with this is that we keep assisting to meetings, conferences, forums,etc. That makes everybody feel bored, and to feel like a waste of time, while this kind of events pretend to be the contrary to that, that is motivating and entertaining.
The book is divided into 9 chapter plus one boarding the different aspect to have in count when you are planning to send a message that resonates with your audience.

**hapter 1 “Why to resonate” ** 
This chapter explains how good communication transform and create change in people, and change is a healthy thing, to accomplish resonance with other people the more important thing to consider is the “human” element, because people dont follow ideas by themselves but they engage because of the emotional hook transmited with the message, there is a lot more happening during communication than just words and resonance is the key.16
  
**Chapter 2 “Lessons from myths and Movies”**  
Chapter two reveals the importance of presenting your data as a story, duality has been in our lives since always and the contrast between good and bad or hot and cold provides the body for telling your presentation as a story, you will persuade presenting the “bad” present and your “good” future with an adventure in between, when finished your story, you can reveal your core message as “the solution”.
  
**Chapter 3 “Get to know the hero”**  
3rd Chapter get the emotional feel out of the spekear and transform it into  a selfless “mentor” who empowers the audience or the “heroe”, this is a very important lesson not only for persuading techniques but to create real bounds with different kind of people in order to be able to work togueter.

**Chapter 4 “Define the journey”** 
In the 4th chapter Nancy show us how to use main and secondary ideas to describe our story as a journey where people can scale through their comfort zone step by step dealing with the always present natural resistance to change, you need to break down the audience old ideas and encourage them again presenting the new ideas as a reward that is worthy to go for.
 
**Chapter 5 “Create meaninful content”**   
At chapter 5 the term divergent thinking comes to the table, to prepare a good presentation we need to collect & create ideas that give us and the audience a divergent way of aproaching our main idea and how we need to create a balance between emotion and logical thoughts, this balance comes from the contrast we speak earlier and by adding this to our story you can engage people on strongest links, emotions and beliefs are masters over reason.
In addition you have to filter your data to make it nice to your audience but you have to proceed very carefully on this because people wont react well to  our presentation if they feel like your leaving something behind, so you have to put attention on this.
“Use your Big Idea to filter out all frequencies other than the Resonant frequency.”

**Chapter 6 “Structure reveals insights”**   
Structure is the name of the game, this is the glue for all the things we have mentioned before, a story that makes sense to people its critical to maintain your audience convinced and to accomplish this you need to structure everything in a coherent way, give to your people a holistic and coherent story if         you pretend to convince anyone.
“The structure is greater than the sum of the parts.”

**Chapter 7 “Delivery something they always remember”**  
This chapter is about the S.T.A.R. Moment.
S.T.A.R. stand for “Something they always remember”, every presentation must leave everybody frenzy and excited about your idea so by planning some sort of catchy moment, this can be done perhaps with the combination of powerfull images and shocking statistics, you do that and people will keep talking about your presentation to others later on.
“Memorable moments are repeated and retransmited so they cover longer distances.”
  
**Chapter 8 “There's always room for improve”**   
Eliminate Noise and Strenght the Signal, to communicate with your audience is vital to send your messages over a good communication channel, that means that you have to plan how you are sending those messages.  
To eliminate noise its better to plan your presentation and make use of good practices, show them yourself with good appearnce, the first impression its important because people will judge if they want to listen to you as soon as you present to them, stablish yourself to them by showing your character, motives and abilities to create an emotional bound with your audience, use slides wisely as people can only attend one thing and practice, practices makes perfect.
“Audience interest is directly proportionate to the presenter's preparation” 
  
**Chapter 9 “Change your world”**  
“The only reason to to give a speech is to change the world”, this means that you must create real and positive value over your idea, everyone that has an idea want's to change the world, if you are passionate you will transmit your passion to people, and you have to be transparent also to remove the idea of personal promotion and get people to focus on the idea.
Build something positive and give people a good story, they'll never forget a good story.
“Inspiration is everywhere”
That good idea resides in your imagination, imagine a future and your idea will keep inspiring people.
Ideas are potent and you imagination can create reality.

  
## 3rd Lecture

## What are the most profound life lessons from stanford professor John Ousterhound?

Every friday proffesor John Ousterhound takes 15 minutes to share his life lessons to the class and here they are some good lessons:

**Number 1:**  
“A little bit of slope makes up for a lot of Y-intercept”

The professor shows this graph and explain to the class that in example the blue line represent “something good” and the red one represents something “not so good” but with a great expectation to exponentially growth, so he explains that it is a lot more important how fast you learn instead of how much to begin with.
This is particularly more true in the systems development enviroments where technology is changing fast and you may know a lot but if you can't keep yourself learning you'll loose your advantage pretty soon.

**Number 2:**  
“The most important component of evolution is death” 
In life, death brings down those things that are not working well anymore, and gives the opportunity to new things to arise.
This is a very tricky thing because we as humans need to keep reinventing ourselfs in order to adapt, but we do also have the maturity phase as an evolutive advantage in the middle of the way, so it is important to find the balance and the inspiration to keep going on the right track.
In the software industry this concept goes beyond because software can be easly modified and change in an easy way, but we are missing the bigger scope of change, as an example teacher says how we keep using windows versions that are 20 years old right now.

**Number 3:**  
“Fear is more dangerous than evil” 
the professor explains how fear puts man into a state of desperation, and desperations leads to irrational and dangerous behaviors.
Humans are complex a we can be assaulted by a lot of internal insecurities and fears, somethimes without being fully conssiousness about it.
We need to ask ourselves while taking decitions, am I doing something because i'm afraid of something.

**Number 4:**  
“The greatest performance improvement of all is when a system goes from not working to working”
When programmers start to work on a idea, sometimes they start to worry very soon about performance and start to adds unnecesary complexity to the initial idea.
This can be hazardous for the materialization of your good idea, the first thing you should worry is to get your program complete quickly but ensuring the quality and how solid it is by focusing on simplicity, not speed.

**Number 5:**   
“Use your intuition to ask questions, not to answer them”
  
This lesson is about confidence and intuition.
When you develop knowledge and experience you can start to decide based on your intuition wich can be sometimes good, but people often get overconfident and this can kill your intuition accuracy.
Be sure to use your intuition as a hipotesis that needs to be verified.

**Number 6:**  
“Facts precedes concepts”
When you are able to understand and/or create concepts, you are building true pieces of knowledge, fact are the tiles that conform a bigger true wich can be structured as a concept.
If you want to learn efectively you have to focus in understanding the concept.

**Number 7:**
“If you dont know what the problem was, you haven't fixed”
When we are facing a problem, we may find dificult to really understand the problem and sometimes we start trying things in order to see if the problem gets solved.
This usually leads to a bad result because you may add complexity to your software witouth knowing if you are really solving the problem, and the problem may appear unnoticed in other parts of your software.

**Number 8:**
“It it hasn't been used, it doesn't work”
In the software industry often happened that you finish a piece of software and get it to test it, if everything is ok you consider it finished and ready.
This is often not true because users usually use your software in ways that you never expect and this may result in buggy or clumpsy software.
It can be hard to accept this but you need to get users to use your software for some time, and only then you may consider it as ready but you have to be ready if the software needs some changes.
  
There are only two kind of software, the proffesor says...  
the ones that starts crappy and eventually becomes great or the ones that starts crappy, and stays that way.

**Number 9:**
“The three more power words for building credibility are “I dont know”  
As humans we try to avoid showing our weaknesses, and this can affect your credibility.
When you admit you dont know something you build credibility and you may get the right kind of help you may need.

**Number 10:**  
“Coherent systems are inherently unstable”  
Coherency in software means that in some grade the parts of your systems shares the same characteristics in some degree.
Natural systems tend to not be coherent, and their elements tend to interact in very complex ways.
This lesson may find a real application in systems security where a flaw can affect your whole system. So you must find a way to break coherency but not functionality.

**Number 11:**
“Scar tissues make relationships wear out”
In bussines and personal life relationships are very important, and professor explains that we may thing that relationships may get broken over a big catastrophic event, but in reality what happened is that we tend to accumulate all the little annoying things we find and this is what eventually takes down a good relationship.
  
It is more important to take care of your relationship from the beginning than to expect to repair something later.
  
**Number 12:**  
“Can you choose your personality?”  
Older people find it more difficult to change than younger people.  
You must never let yourself to think that you can not change anymore,  
people tend to copy other people and if you do, you better find a good figure for you.  
   
Stay ready for change anytime it is necessary and keep adopting good practices and habits.  
  
The statement “I was born this way” is false and you may not be perfect but certainly you are perfectible, evolve yourself every day.

**“The Pretotyping Manifesto - Stanford Graduate School of Business“**  
(By Alberto Savoia at Stanford Graduate School of Business.   
January 2012.)  
The Pretotyping manifesto is a revolutionary approach to effectively give life to new ideas.
First things first, as we all  have the best insterest in changing the world, sometimes we came up with a “really god idea”, but in reality the vast majority of ideas wont succeed in becoming a useful reality as we planned, so why does this happen?
The Law of Failure states that: “Most of ideas fail even if they are well performed”, there is always soome degree of uncertainty but how do we manage this to boost the probabilty for ideas to become a reality?.
The innovation process has improve over time and Prototypes (Proto not Preto) become an improvement over the creation of a full product.
The data for measure the succeed of the innovation process states that you have to:   
**1. Try Fast and**  
**2. Fail Fast.**  
In order to succeed more quickly and in a cheaper way.  
There are some other things you need to be carefull with:  
Opinions are subjective and dangerous.  
Make sure yo uare building the right “it” before you built “it”.  
How you succeed those obstacles and how you have to take the next step:  
Successful Ideas must find balance between   
-Vision  
-Ideas  
-Opinions  
-Good Innovation occurs in between  
-Reality  
-Prototyping  
-Data   
Now we want to take all this to the next level, and that is how the Pretotyping  comes into the game:    
Pretotypes are agile versions of Prototypes; Pretotypes are facades that work to test the acceptance of a product before it is builded or even prototyped, the difference is that 
**Prototypes answer the question: can we build it?** , and   
**Pretotypes answer the question: Would we use it?**  
So why we should care about this, because it is cheaper and faster.
And based on that and the data for measuring and planning the succeed of the innovation process the “Pretotype Manifesto” was born.
-Pretotype Manifesto:    
-Innovators beats Ideas   
-Pretotypes beats Prototypes   
-Data beats Opinions   
-Doing beats Talking   
-Simple beats Complex   
-Not beats Later   
-Commitment beats Committes    
If you want to give life to an idea, first you have to prove that people would use it, and how cheap and fast you iterate through this process will lead you to succeed more quickly.

**“Inbox Zero”**
(By Merlin Mann at Google Talks
July 23, 2007)

The video called Inbox Zero reveals an important thing that can kill your productivity and that it your email inbox, the modern personal and proffesional life demands an extensive use of the email and Merlin Mann shares to us how he manages this situation.
To make your time more valuable you need to get things done and checking your email in a constantly demands you to become a multitasker.
Multitask may be a good thing but humans are not designed to work that way, there are studies that prove that focusing on one task at the time gives better results than to be working on many on the same time, that is why Marlin Mann remind us that time and attention are finite and he suggest a simple thing. 
Limit the options you use for email.  
Do not check your email all the time, if can turn it definetively off its better.  
If you still need to use your email, process your email to inmediate solutions, if you find several mails related on the same topic, you can improve your time by looking for an answer that fits all and apply this such as a software developer uses design patterns for solving similar solutions.
Be proactive at managing the action of your life and boost your productivity.

**“The Birth & Death of JavaScript” ** 
(By Gary Bernhardt from PyCon 2014)   
This presentations exposes how the design flaws inside Javascript will eventually lead that lenguaje to death despite his tremendous popularity, it is the most used programming lenguaje in present but will it survive through time?
Gary Bernhardt does a remarkable job trying to predict why this lenguaje will eventually die, because it depends on a lot of other technology structures that are changing.
To mention some of the design flaws considered by Gary are that JavaScript uses a “single unified number type” and that “all key values are converted to strings”, it doesn't manage a true “hash type map” and that can lead in some cases to unndesirable or unnexpected behavior, one example exposed is that JavaScript can return unnexpected values when declaring functions with 1 argument but call it without it or to call to a function using several arguments, and this happend because the compiler may get confused at some level because of the unndefined data types and hash type tables.
The presentation also remarks the facts that the execution of JavaScript dependes on many layers of compilers in order to work in all browsers and architechtures and this is a continous decrease of efficienty.  
And so we will have to see how the future of this wide used technology goes.

**“Tokens, Pariahs, and Pioneers ”  **
(By Malcolm Gladwell, The New Yorker Festival, 2013)   
  
The pressentation of Malcolm Gladwell reveals in a coherent way how some of the social phenomenon has been molding modern society and try to make a disctintion over Pariahs, Tokens and Pioneers.
Malcolm show us by constrasting different examples in history how society has changed by the Pioneers who create a door to include a certain minority into bigger groups and change that society forever.
Malcolm shows how humans behavior in groups does not represent a linear progression, he points three kind of minorities wich are the Pariahs who represents a minority over a larger group, but pariahs doesnt change the way on how that larger groups treatss or thinks about that minority, then the term Token appears, and tokens are minorities who do infiltrate and change the way of how larger groups perceive and threat that minority, but the change made by tokens is not general nor persistent, and then we got the Pioneers, pioneers are individuals that infiltrate and change how the majorities treat the group that the pioneer represent.
Why pioneers accomplish that change, because of the way of how pioneers think and act is different, its looking on the big scope and spread a different idea through his circles, pioneers often take the sacrify of being atacked by the resistance of change of that majority, but pioneers survive and build the reputation needed to convince that majority.

**“Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce”**  
(By Malcolm Gladwell, TED Talks, 2007)   
  
Choice, Happiness and Spaguetti sauce is a story to teach us how the creator of the “Extra Chunky” spaguetti sauce Howard Moskowits revolution the way in wich how the food industry and de industry in general thought about market and the people choices.
The people who creates products based on the majority choice, and think that people get happy by that offer, but what Howard and a couple or more individuals find out were that the big groups of people will want many different versions of a product and the industry was limiting his market reach by target the bigger groups instead of create different versions of the product for a cluster of different targets in were sales are superior.
This doesnt happen magically, Howard had to ask people to try every version of the product he had in hands and then collect all the information, analyzed it and come to the conclusion that in products there is no perfect “it”.
Plus he also do a interesting experiment, he took an accepted product, wrap it with a different cover and raise its price, the reaction of the people who buy it was unnexpected, they showed themselves happier when aquiring the product, he finds out that to people, expensive things had an inspiring effect.
People dont know what they want, but if you give them a democracy of choices you will find out, plus you offer different versions of costs of that product to make them happier, who would it guess?.

**“The unheard story of David and Goliath”**  
(By Malcolm Gladwell, TED Talks, 2013)   
  
The story of David and Goliath is a widespread story from the bible that relates how a young man fights and defeat a giant, in this presentation Malcolm Gladwell told how he understand the story based on his discoveries, but while he tell us the story let us to learn a very valuable lesson.
The story holds a lot of mysticism but Malcolm is able to bring that story to the ground and let us see as a clear example one of the most important characteristics that a man can have in order to fight obstacles, and that is the wit.
Speaking metaphoraly the story is about a giant, giant as any heavy mass of resources, and david is young and apparenhttp://itools.com/tool/google-translate-web-page-translatortly not well armed to fight the so called giant, but david represents the wit, david dont have an opportunity to defeat the giant or at least thats what the giant thinks, because the giant is bigger in some sense and expects the enemy to be like him and to fight like him, but david is a completely different situation in here, and david has the wit and the courage to fight goliath, and in the end david could win.
Dont underestimate your wit to accomplish big things and dont be afraid of “giants” because “giants” are not as strong as you think.

**“Jonathan Haidt: Religion, evolution, and the ecstasy of self-transcendence”**  
(By Jonathan Haidt, TED Talks, 2014)   
  
Great presentation from Jonathan Haidt, he boards one of the most important aspect in humans lives and how evolution has the evidence to prove what is the way for humans to grow and survive.
Jonathan throws a fundamental question to the public: Why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way, shape or form?
When we talks about abstract concepts like this is always difficult to express the kind of experiences that has made man to feel as a part of something bigger and to integrate this experience in its inner self.
The presentation show us how evolution has proved that the groups that collaborate toguether are the ones that survive in extreme cases, that lead us to  understand our natural instinct to create tribal groups in work as a whole.
We are the result of cells that cooperate togueter in order to form organs, and organs work toguetter in order to conform a body and when we get consiusness about it we understand that no matter what our differences are, we have to adapt and cooperate togueter if we want to survive.
There is no other more powerfull force than cooperation, and when we understand that we are all on the same boat we are going to accomplish the greatest thing of all, we will transcend.

**“Creative Thinking Hacks ”**  
(By Scott Berkun, CreativeMornings Seattle,  2013)   
  
Creative Thinking Hacks is a presentation to encourage people to be creative and to think different about the creativity.
The first thing is that we need to realize that Ideas born from others ideas, they are not isolated, instead they can be seen as a combination of a lot of other ideas builded togueter.
Creativity it one of the most important aspects for us to transcend problems and the enviroment may not always be as inspiring as we want.
If you want to change the world first you have to have an idea and we all have the capacity to do it so dont be afraid and never ever let your enviroment to kill your creativity.
  
##10th Video  
**“How Progress Really Happend”**
(By Scott Berkun, Tools of Change conference,  2009)   
  
How progress really happened is a question that a lot a people has done to theirselves and cience and history has reveal some interesting facts about it.
The main character in progress is people.
People usually thinks that progress is going to come with technology but when going back in history, we see that transcendent changes occurs when people convince other people to push it, and those who cant embrace change eventually “die”, some of the greatest progress man has made has been achieved using the most basic tools like a pen, and this kind of proves that progress is made by people, not technology.
The process of change always comes with resistance because we can not live in constant progression, humans need stability from time to time so we have develop this kind of resistance to change, is not always bad, but we also need to keep ourselves very alert when the time to change comes and be able to adapt to those change.
When a man develops an idea to push progress is going to fight against a lot of idea killers, and progress is only achieved by those who can manage to develop all the strenght, tactics and qualities needed to overcome the resistance of others to change.


##Personal Summary  
Week 1 has been intense and nutritive in personal and cultural empowerment, the topics boarded on week 1 were People, Innovation, Lenguaje and Communication and Personal resources management in order to get things done.
The historical information about how changes has been introduced by people, presents a very important revelation to keep in mind which is that all the transcendental or substantial changes that has ocurred has been possibly made are do it by people, technology by itself does not change anything.
The thing is how people inserts his visions into society, so it is important to encourage creativity, liberty and conciousness into people to feed a constant and positive change into all. 
Innovation is one of the most interesting activities for humanity because since the beginning of times we have proved to have a natural instinct to find problems and solve them as our level of creativity allow us, but we also tend to fall into a static state because we need stability from time to time, thats just natural human needs, the importan thing is to keep ourselves concious about that and do a proactive exercise to push ourselfves outside from the comfort zone  and keep improving and inventing new ways of doing.
Humans have not answered yet the philosophical questions which are:  
who are we?, where do we come from?, and where should we go?.  
We keep empowering us and our way of living in order to move ourselves nearest to answer and achieve the meaning of life.     
And then, lenguaje comes in:  
We as humans experience a lot of physical or abstracts emotions and thoughts, we have the power to visit a magical place where inifite creativity resides, wich is our minds, And one of the most important aspects of our lives not only for survival but for accomplish our fullness as humans is to be able to feel in communion. Communication can occurs in many different ways but sometimes we need to send Effectively a message for many reasons.
Effective lenguaje is one of the most powerful tools for achieving personal fulness, changes in societies and to get comunities to be able to work togeter, effective communication requieres to keep in the play a lot of circumstances since we all are differents and our vision is subjective, so as we grow our lenguaje transmition capabilities we are able to achieve more things toguether.
  
One of the biggest problems in the present time is that we come to society loaded with a cultural heritage that may be incompatible or incorrect in many ways, and we may be able to detect this but not able to do anything in the short time, so it is important to keep empowering people and sharing knowledge to be able to share and focus on bigger things, stop fighting against each other and understand that we are all under the same sun and that is better to work togueter for the greatest good for all, lenguaje is the bridge that connect us all and we should definetly improve our comunication skills.
